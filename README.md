3- Challenges Faced and Solutions

Image File Format Compatibility: Initially, I encountered issues with JPG files not loading correctly in the deployment environment. To address this, I converted the image files to PNG format, ensuring compatibility across different platforms and browsers.

Responsive Design Challenges: Initially, I used Tailwind CSS for styling, but I faced responsiveness issues, especially on smaller devices. To overcome this, I transitioned to writing CSS code manually and incorporated media queries to ensure consistent and effective responsiveness across various screen sizes and devices.

Design Creation: Creating a visually appealing and user-friendly design from scratch was a significant challenge. To tackle this, I researched modern design trends, read some UI/UX rules put online & refined the design based on feedback from other people. By combining creativity with usability considerations, I was able to develop a basic design that effectively communicates my skills and experiences while providing an engaging user experience.
